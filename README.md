ansible-role-candlepin
=========
An Ansible role that installs and deploys Candlepin for development or testing purposes.

This role is intended for use with newer Candlepin branches, but the resultant environment may still be used
with older builds with some minor tweaks or configuration changes within the environment after provisioning.



Requirements
------------
Candlepin has many requirements for its developers. You will need a Fedora or CentOS box, or RHEL with EPEL
enabled to use this role. It is recommmended that that box has a non-root user to run Candlepin on (see
variables below).


Dependencies
------------
This role depends on the `rvm1.ruby` role for installing and configuring RVM. At the time of writing, Candlpin
has a strict requirement on Ruby 2.4, which is installed and managed via RVM.



Role Variables
--------------
There are a number of variables which enable various features and aspects of a developer environment. The
primary flow control variables are the six boolean variables listed below:

- `cp_configure_postgresql`: controls whether or not PostgreSQL will be installed and configured; defaults to
  true
- `cp_configure_mariadb`: controls whether or not MariaDB will be installed and configured; defaults to true
- `cp_configure_user_env`: controls whether or not some convenience features for the user environment will
  be setup, such as bash prompts, colors, copying in SSH keys, etc.; defaults to false
- `cp_configure_debugging`: controls whether or not Tomcat will be configured for remote debugging and
  profiling via YourKit; defaults to false
- `cp_git_checkout`: whether or not the Candlepin repo will be cloned via git; defaults to true
- `cp_deploy`: whether or not Candlepin will be deployed after provisionining the system; defaults to true


For some of these tasks, some operations may be modified or configured by changing further variables. A full
list of variables which are intended to be modified on a per-environment basis can be found in the
`defaults/main.yml` file.


User Configuration
------------------
By default, Candlepin will be cloned and deployed from the `devel` directory in the `candlepin` user's home
directory, but this can be modified by changing the three Candlepin home or user variables listed below:

- `candlepin_user`: the user to install, build, and run as; defaults to "candlepin"
- `candlepin_user_home`: the home directory of the selected user; defaults to "/home/{{candlepin_user}}"
- `candlepin_home`: the home directory for the Candlepin checkout or mapping; defaults to
  "{{candlepin_user_home}}/devel/candlepin"

In many cases, this can be left as-is. However, in the case of a Vagrant deployment, it is likely these will
need to be changed accordingly. For example, in a typical Vagrant setup where the Candlepin repo is mapped in
from the host, these variables might be configured as follows:

```
  ansible_user: vagrant
  candlepin_user: vagrant
  candlepin_home: /vagrant
```


Git Configuration
-----------------
This role can clone Candlepin directly from git rather than having to map or copy it onto the host. Three
variables control whether or not this action is performed, and what repo and tag is cloned.

- `cp_git_checkout`: whether or not to perform a git checkout at all; defaults to true
- `cp_git_repo`: a URI to the repo to check out, may use any repo reference supported by the git command;
  defaults to "https://github.com/candlepin/candlepin"
- `cp_git_ref`: a git ref tag indicating the branch, tag, or reference to checkout; defaults to "master"



Deploying Candlpin
------------------
By default, this role will deploy Candlepin if the repo exists in the configured location. The deployment
can be configured by passing args accepted by Candlepin's deployment tool. See the documentation associated
with that tool for details on its parameters.

- `cp_deploy`: whether or not to deploy Candlepin as part of the provisioning step; defaults to true
- `cp_deploy_args`: the arguments to pass to the Candlepin deploy tool; defaults to "-gta"

By default, Candlepin will be deployed in a way that drops and re-creates its database from scratch, imports
synthetic test data, and then regenerates the candlepin.conf with default settings for PostgreSQL support.
To change this to use MySQL/MariaDB instead, add the `-m` argument to the variable:

```
  cp_deploy_args: '-gtam'
```


YourKit Configuration
---------------------
If the `cp_configure_debugging` variable is set, this role will configure Tomcat for both remote debugging
support, and, optionally, YourKit profiling support. To setup YourKit with this role, a Linux-compatible
agent library must be present on the host at the location specified in the `cp_yourkit_library` variable. If
this value is not provided, or the library is not present at that location, the YourKit tasks will be skipped.

- `cp_yourkit_library`: the path to the YourKit Java profiling agent on the host system; defaults to
  "/opt/yjp/bin/linux-x86-64/libyjpagent.so"
- `cp_yourkit_agent_port`: the port on which the agent should listen for profiling clients; defaults to 35675



Vagrant Integration
-------------------
This role can be used with Vagrant to quickly spin up a VM with a fully prepared development environment. In
such cases, it is heavily advised to set the `candlepin_user` variable accordingly, at minimum.

An example playbook for Vagrant use is as follows:
```
---
- hosts: all

  environment:
    JAVA_HOME: /usr/lib/jvm/java

  roles:
    - role: candlepin

  vars:
    ansible_user: vagrant
    candlepin_user: vagrant
    candlepin_home: /vagrant

    cp_configure_postgresql: true
    cp_configure_mariadb: true
    cp_configure_user_env: true
    cp_configure_debugging: true

    cp_git_checkout: false
    cp_deploy: false

    rvm1_rubies: ['ruby-2.4']
    rvm1_user: "{{ candlepin_user }}"
    rvm1_bundler_install: true
```

The above playbook would provision the VM with PostgreSQL and MariaDB support, configure the user environment,
and configure Tomcat for remote debugging and profiling. It would not check out the Candlepin repo, and,
obviously, would not deploy it.

Note that when using this role from Vagrant, the `rvm1_*` variables must be re-specified, even if unchanged,
to ensure they are present when the rvm role is invoked.
